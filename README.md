# CalculatingProductPriceUsingJavaScript

## My manager asked me calculating the final price of 30k+ products by their pricing rules. So I wrote this JS code logic and finished the task with out.csv file.

run npm install to load dependencies before run node index.js

Target price calculation

The competitors: Competitor 1-8(names disclosed).

Suppliers: Supplier 1-8(names disclosed)

Products: all products names and vendercodes disclosed

Rules:
1.Generally match the lowest price in the competitors specified except:
a.If the lowest price is X% (or $Y, whichever is smaller) lower than second lowest price, then use second lowest price timed by 0.99 as the target price
Our Company price range | X% | $Y
------------------------|----|----
Greater than $1500| 2% | 50
$800-$1500 | 3% | 30
$500 to $800 | 3% | 18
$300 to $500 | 4% | 15
$100 to $300 | 7% | 10
<=$100 | 10%| 8

b.There are 4 scenarios of stock availability in price comparison:
i.OurCompany has stock competitor has stock
ii.OurCompany has stock competitor has no stock
iii.OurCompany has no stock competitor has stock
iv.OurCompany has no stock competitor has no stock

The rule 1a applies to 1b1), 1b3) and 1b4) above.

c.In the event of 1b2), OurCompany has stock and the cheapest competitor has no stock, then we exclude that the cheapest no stock competitor, move to the second cheapest competitor.
